What this program could do to follow the 7 principles of universal design (ethics).

1. Equitable use
- We could add an option for users to reorder the menu options to better suit their needs
- Provide different ways to access menu options configurable through a settings menu
- Program follows equitable use by the fact that the pet system is not different for regular users and admins (both users have the same system of pets)

2. Flexibility in use
- Like mentioned earlier, provide options to reconfigure menu options and means to access these options
- Incorporate a GUI for people who do not have a keyboard available

3. Simple and intuitive use
- Program mostly follows this principle
- Information could be better arranged in order of importance (based on a UI/UX study)

4. Perceptible information
- Incorporating a GUI could mean the information is easier to be understood regardless of environment
- Make the program compatible with braille so that blind users could enjoy the program (would require research and design teams)

5. Tolerance for error
- There could be warnings for unsupported actions a user could take
- Catch errors that could break the .ser database

6. Low physical effort
- The program could have a keywords option where a user can assign keywords to specific phrases or words
- The program could have a user finder feature so that it is easier to find the list of users instead of going through the .ser database

7. Size and space for approach and use
- If we used a GUI, we could make sure the buttons are of adequate size so that it is easier to use (it could also be configured in the menus)
- Improve formatting of the text so that it is easier to see all important menu options in the terminal
