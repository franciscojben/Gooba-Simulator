# Domain: Tamagotchi

Each user will have their own pet which they can log in to access.

They will only be able to have 1 pet at a time.

There will be a timer that starts running while logged in, there will be time based care events for the user 
to complete or their pet will get sick or die.

The timer stops once logged out or the pet dies.

There will be a global leaderboard across all users stored locally for longest lived pet etc.

Once tamagotchis die their name will be stored in a past pets database with  # of days lived. 

Once a pet dies, the user will have the option to hatch a new one.
