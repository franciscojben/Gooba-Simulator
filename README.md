# GOOBA SIMULATOR

**IMPORTANT** Before starting the program, make sure that you have correctly set up Java.  This program is written with JDK 11 in mind, so it is recommended that you use Java 11.

Here are the instructions to start the program

- To run the program, access the Main file that is located in the src directory.  Make sure the SDK is setup and that JUnit is included (if you are running unit tests)
    - If you are not running the program through IntelliJ, you may have to compile the java files to class files first.  It is recommended to use IntelliJ as it will do this automatically for you
- After setting up the java files, run the green arrow in Main (or the compiled file if you compiled it manually) and everything should be ready for you
    - Please keep in mind that the program relies on user interaction with the terminal
- The program should now be ready to use!

# KNOWN ISSUES

Whenever there is a change to the entities, the database must completely reset.  In the case that there is an error
with the database, go into `src/data` and remove all contents inside the `.ser` files.  

While this will remove all user and pet data in the system, it will allow you to access the program.
